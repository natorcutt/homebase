<h2> Scrum Workshop Reflection </h2> 
<p> In all I would say that my group members in my scrum team were very helpful! My other two group 
members were a lot further along than me in how much of their websites or portfolios had been 
completed, however they helped me a lot with my formatting difficulties in CSS and I would like to think I helped 
them with some of their more nit picky issues such as alignment difficulties </p> 

<p> Coming into the scrum session my biggest issues were probably centering my header, nav bar, and then underneath both of those 
elements, figuring out how to put my text box around my landing page picture. After a few minutes of nothing we tried working, 
I eventually figured out that I had linked my CSS stylesheet to my index page improperly, so after that fix, there were only 
a few quick alterations to my code to make before I could more easily format all of the content on my pages. Additionally, my group members filled me in 
on the concept of a "container div", which I had previously thought was just a device Codeacademy had created to teach us about classes and ids, but once the 
height and width of my container div was set my life got so much easier. </p> 

<p> Things I tried to help my teammates with were slightly similar. Both of my partners had the same difficulties of formatting 
their text to be on the right side of their head shot on their landing pages. Also Sam had some nav bar issues that we were able to sort out 
where her links weren't working and we had to figure out what html files were for each page and make sure they were all in the same local file 
so that it would be easier. Overall I think I got a lt out of the process just because talking it out with my peers accelerated the 
process more than it would have been achieved with me just angrily typing and retyping code trying to figure out what the problem could be. </p>
