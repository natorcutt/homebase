<article id="resumewrite">
<p> I have been fortunate to continue some of my life-long interests through college. Having spent two years working on an 
Internation Baccalaureate Diploma in high school, I have always been interested in International Relations and have been able to 
continue learning about and being a global citizen through Model United Nations. This has been an amazing experience for me 
and I look forward to continuing my involvement in my years to come. Being a Spartan Ambassador is also something I take a lot of pride 
in being involved in and it has been an incredibly enriching experience, not only to display school spirit and meet new prospective students
and their families in tours throughout the week, but it has also taught me a lot about problem solving and figuring out how to make sure that 
people from all parts of the country have an enjoyable tour experience while 'selling them' on the concept of attending Michigan State University. 
As well as these recent experiences, I have also had the pleasure of working at Adogo Pet Hotel where I have been able to learn a lot about interacting 
with customers and being on a team in a different sense than a sports team, where everyone's overall safety and the success of the business depends on
continued and constant teamwork.
