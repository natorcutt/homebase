<p> Overall, my portfolio has been very similar to my overall set of design markups. 
One thing however that I did enjoy about both creating the design markups and just in general thinking 
about the layout of my portfolio, I really liked that my header was kind of underneath 
my nav bar with a lighter opacity. Obviously this is a lot easier of a job to do in photoshop, and right now I am just struggling 
with the alignment of my nav bar, pictures, text and header image so I'm not really in a position to play around with it just yet. 
I have however come up with the idea to have my resume picture and home page picture be the exact same CSS, because originally I wanted them to be nearly in the same area
anyway, so now once I figure out how to align it and it's surrounding text, I won't ever have to fix it or alter it for my resume page. 
One thing that I hadn't anticipated that was a difference between my markup and physically coding my portfolio was the amount of white space. 
I wanted a lot of white space because I like the simplicity of it and I think on Photoshop and Illustrator there was 
the perfect amount of white space, however (maybe its just because I have a wide Mac screen) 
but on the actual website there is ALOT of white space. But its definitely growing on me and I really like where I am at right now. </p>
