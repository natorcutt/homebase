<p id="bio"> I’m originally from Minnetonka, Minnesota and just graduated from Minnetonka High School in 2014 in the 
International Bacclaureate Diploma Programme. Currently, I’m a freshman at Michigan State University majoring in 
Experience Architecture with a Specialization in Design. In high school I was very active in Dance Team, 
Volleyball and my high school’s art program and at MSU I am currently a Spartan Ambassador/Campus tour guide 
and involved in Mighigan State Model United Nations. 
	I have always been very interested in art and people’s responses to innovative design concepts which was 
what originally prompted me to begin studying web design in college. However, as I’ve gone through classes 
and research projects and  learned more about accessibility on the web and site’s overall interaction I hope 
to be an active participant in accessibility and usability research in my coming years at Michigan State and 
in my future careers. I think that combining constantly imporiving programing and usability systems on the web 
with aesthetically eye catching designs can really take User Experience to the next level and I look forward to 
learning and growing in these areas in the coming years. </p>
