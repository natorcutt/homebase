	<h2 class="portfolio"> Personal Portfolio Mock Up </h2>
		<p class="description"> For my class "Introduction to Web Authoring" we were instructed to code an entire personal online
		portfolio or website for our final grade. The beginning step for me coding this entire website from scratch was deciding what I 
		would want it to look like. I have always enjoyed minimalist or simple website structures so I wanted the overall look to be clean 
		but felt that I had to also be true to myself and include a great deal of color. This link is a pdf of the original Adobe Illustrator
		art board I created for my sites landing page, despite it being altered throughout the process. </p> 
	
	<h2 class="portfolio"> Portfolio Header</h2> 
		<p class="description"> As I described above, my landing page and creating this header image were really my first encounters with Adobe Illustrator
		or any type of Graphic Design, however I hope to improve my skills in the future as I Specialize my degree in Design. I chose to create a hexagonal pattern 
		with varying colors and opacities because while I felt that I needed to include a good amount of color, I thought using a geometric shape to do so would still keep it looking 
		overall more ordered and professional. </p>
