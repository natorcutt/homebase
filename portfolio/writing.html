	<h2 class="portfolio"> The Effect of Virtual Communities and Support Groups on the Disabled </h2>
		
		<p class="description"> This was research paper was written as an Honor Option for a Sociology
		 class called "Society and the Individual" outside of the regular course work. The paper discusses the recent research of Anthropologist Dr. Gerald Gold 
		 of York University in Toronto about the inter-workings of online support groups for patients with terminal illnesses or disabilities, specifically Multiple Sclerosis. 
		 In addition to reading through Dr. Gold's un-published work I corresponded with him about the accessibility of the specific virtual communities or support groups he 
		 used, as well as the technical and anthropological aspects of his work. </p>
	<h2 class="portfolio"> Film Critique </h1> 
		
		<p class="description"> As a class project for Art History: Renaissance and Baroque, we were required to write a film review on the film “The Mill and the Cross”  which is essentially a film created 
		out of Peter Bruegel’s The Way to Calvary.  After learning about differing forms of critiques, we were asked to compare various other critiques 
		about the film from sources like the New York Times and then offer our own additional critique.  </p>
