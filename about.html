<h1> How it Works:</h1>
	<article class="modes">

		<div class="tcolor">
		<p>Using cutting edge technology, SmartSight will free the viewer from distractions and allow 
		them to either focus more on what is going on around them, or focus more on the ask at hand while 
		maintaining awareness of their surroundings. </p>
		
		<p>Using the headphone ear bud attached to each pair of SmartLens glasses, the viewer can 
		turn their SmartLens glasses onto SmartSight mode, and the SmartLens Assistant will call out 
		important objects in the viewer’s surroundings, alert them to potential dangers, things they 
		might run into if they are distracted, and give directions. </p>
		
		<p>The SmartSight feature is also the first set of Smart glasses that are proven to assist in 
		Accessibility and mobility for customers with visual impairments, specifically for low vision 
		customers. The ability of SmartLens to narrate, point out possible obstacles and explain the viewer’s 
		surroundings, and give directions significantly improve the customer’s independence and freedom to move 
		around a specific area on their own. </p>

		<p>Through enhanced Bluetooth connectivity, SmartLens allows you to preset which mobile 
		applications and accounts you would like to recieve push notifications from on your SmartLens lenses.  </p>
		
		<p>By allowing you personalize what notifications you see and which are of importance to you, SmartLens 
allows you to simplify your life, while always staying up to date and in the know- without ever having to 
check your phone screen again. </p>

	<p>Update Mode also gives you the ability to filter which notifications appear on which lens, offering 
	you an additional layer of personalization and customization. </p>
