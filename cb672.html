	<h2> $295.99 </h2>
	<p> Sleek and simple, a beloved classic with a fresh new take. The AK288 frames are exactly 
	what you wouldn&#39;t expect from a pair of smart glasses, which is what makes them so innovative. 
	Show your personality and trend-setting style in these polycarbonate frames, that come in either 
	black, black/grey or tortoise shell. <p>

		<h4> Leave the Watch at Home </h4> 
		<h4> &bigstar; &bigstar; &bigstar; &bigstar; &bigstar;</h4>
		<p> by AmySanders </p> 
		<p> As a former Apple Watch user, I have tried out various products in an effort to better multi-task 
		and give me some independence without always having to look at my phone screen. </p> 
		<p> SmartLens has allowed me to go hours without ever having to take my phone out of my purse, all while staying in the 
		loop with people I care about, and recieving all of my daily remiders. My constant anxiety about not having my 
		phone or checking my phone all of the time is slowly going away, and its all thanks to SmartLens! It runs my life 
		and manages what I’m doing and the things I care about for me- and I love it!! </p>

		<h4> Stylish and Useful </h4> 
		<h4> &bigstar; &bigstar; &bigstar; &bigstar;</h4>
		<p> by MarkQuist </p> 
		<p> Love these frames, super stylish and on trend with my life. I have never felt so freed by a piece 
		of technology or pair of glasses and love how seemlessly they coordinate with my phone. If you are ever 
		feeling lonely or distracted, or potentially can&#39;t see very well in a certain situation (like late at night), 
		SmartSight is invalueable and provides a nice comforting voice to tell me what to do or what is going around me. </p>
